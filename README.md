## Description

*Just Another Text Editor* – but a simple one for storing your 3am code snipets that pour forth from your febrile mind. It's alright you can go back to sleep... you didn't even have to turn the WiFi on. It works offline too.

This web application meets Progressive Web App (PWA) criteria. As such it features a number of data persistence techniques and functions offline.

The data is stored in an IndexedDB database and the app uses the necessary methods for getting and updating this data.
